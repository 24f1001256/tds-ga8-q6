2. RAWGraphs (https://rawgraphs.io) was used to import the dataset.
3. Selected chart type: **Alluvial Diagram**.
4. Mapped:
   - `source` → *Source*
   - `target` → *Target*
   - `value`  → *Size/Weight*
5. Customized colors and labels for professional presentation.
6. Exported final visualization as **PNG (300–512px)** named `chart.png`.

## Purpose
